            <h4>Marion "Tank" LeFleur</h4>
            <p>Tank is Newell-Simon Hall's roboceptionist. Tank joined us fresh from Iraq where he did reconnaissance for the CIA. Please stop in the lobby of Newell-Simon to say hello to Tank. He'll be glad to see you! Tank has had an interesting life that's been getting even more interesting since he came to Carnegie Mellon.</p>

            <img src="/assets/img/team/bones.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>Blueberry BONES</h4>
            <p>Bones is Tank's robo-pup. For some reason, the little metal canine insists on calling himself "Blueberry" and isn't really the most obedient of dogs. Could someone have been messing with his obedience code?</p>

            <img src="/assets/img/team/drreid.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>Dr. Reid</h4>
            <p>Dr. Reid is the head of the Roboceptionist Project at Newell-Simon. As such he never tires of telling Tank what to do. He is Tank’s immediate supervisor and the human he answers to. But Tank and Dr. Reid are headed for trouble. Tank decides that you really can't trust these slide-rule types and that Dr. Reid bears close watching.</p>

            <img src="/assets/img/team/val.gif" alt="">
            <h4>Valerie</h4>
            <p>What’s there to say about Valerie? What isn’t there? Val is a top of the line A.I. robot determined to make it in a world of humans and machines. After a long tenure as Newell-Simon Hall's roboceptionist, Valerie has found her dream job performing with a Streisand cover band, Babs and the Babettes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team-text span4">
            <img src="/assets/img/team/Xavier.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>Xavier</h4>
            <p>Xavier is an older robot, father to Amelia. He's a robot emeritus at Newell-Simon having been created in 1993. He's very dapper and always wears a stainless steel suit, but he isn't very friendly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team-text span4">
            <img src="/assets/img/team/Amelia.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>Amelia</h4>
            <p>Amelia, Tank and Valerie are sure that they are related way back. They have the same body type and felt like they were looking in a mirror when they ran into each other during Tank's interview for the roboceptionist job. Tank, of course, feels as though his visage exudes a certain manliness that his female compatriots lack.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team-text span4">
            <img src="/assets/img/team/grace.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>Grace</h4>
            <p>One of Tank and Valerie's old friends at Newell-Simon. Grace is much more coordinated than Valerie and Tank, but not as articulate or full of personality.</p>
